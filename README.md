# :tada: Want to start your journey in Open Source?! :tada:
Made this for anyone who wants to start but is annoyed in finding out "good first issues" arent really begginer friendly. At least from my experiance so far. 

## Watch this quick straight to the point video if you're confused (like I was once)
[Contributing to Open Source Can Change Your Life - Hereâ€™s How to Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML6vfKjQss)

## Here are the steps to follow to contribute to this project
1. Fork this repo
2. Navigate to your desktop and clone the repo you just forked 
3. Make a branch. Name it whatever your heart desires bruh 
4. Install dependencies! 
`npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`). After you installed that go ahead and install `npm install @picocss/pico`
5. Make changes! 
6. Navigate to **src** folder. 
7. Then click on **routes** folder and in there you should see a file called **contributors.ts**
8. Add the following code(repalce the info with yours of course) in **contributors.ts**
```
// contributors add your code below this line
{
  name: 'Raul',
  github: 'https://github.com/Raulj123'
},
```
9. Run (To see your changes!)
``` 
npm run dev 
```


10. Your done! go ahead and push your changes bruh :triumph:


Decided to make this at 11pm at night while I was looking for open source projects that were begginer freindly unfortunately those are hard to find :disappointed:
